Leetcode Questions

1) 2148: Count Elements With Strictly Smaller and Greater Elements

i) Find the min element and max element in the array
ii) Iterate through the array to check if the element is less that the max and greater than the min
iii) Increase the count if condition is meet and after the loop return the count.

2) 766: Toeplitz Matrix

i) Nested loops outer(i till i<n-1) and inner(j till j<m-1) 
ii) Check if a[i][j]!=a[i+1][j+1] and if satisfy return false
iii) After the loops return true

3) 605: Can place flowers

i) if n==0 return true;
ii) if size of flowerbed ==0 return false
iii) if size of flowerbed == 1 then check if it is 0 then return true else false
iv) Iterate through the array
v) Divide into three cases when i==0,i==size-1 and else
vi) When i==0 check if the current is 0 and the next is 0 then place the flower on i and decrement n by 1
vii) When i==size-1 check if the current is 0 and the before one is 0 then place the flower on i and decrement n by 1
viii) Else case if current element is 0 and before is 0 and after is 0 then place flower at i and decrement n by 1
ix) If n is 0 then return true
x) After loop return false

4) 134: Gas Station

ii) Initialize three variables:
    a) total = 0 (to track total gas balance)
    b) curr = 0 (to track current gas balance)
    c) start = 0 (possible starting index)

ii) Traverse the gas stations from index 0 to n-1.

iii) At each station, calculate the difference:
    diff = gas[i] - cost[i]

iv) Add diff to total and curr.

v) If curr becomes negative, then the journey cannot start from the current start index.

vi) Update start to i + 1 and reset curr to 0.

vii) Continue this process for all stations.

viii) After completing the loop, check if total is greater than or equal to 0.

ix) If total >= 0, return start as the valid starting index.

x) If total < 0, return -1 (not possible to complete the circuit).
