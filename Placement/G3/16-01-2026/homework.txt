HACK WITH INFY

Sample 1:

i) Store the energy drained by each exercise in an array A.

ii) Sort the array A in descending order.

iii) Initialize two variables:
    a) energy = E
    b) count = 0

iv) Traverse the sorted array.

v) For each exercise, perform it at most two times.

vi) After each performance, subtract the exercise energy from energy and increment count.

vii) If energy becomes less than or equal to 0, return count.

viii) If all exercises are performed and energy is still greater than 0, return -1.
